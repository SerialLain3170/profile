Present Day, Present Time...  
Hello, I'm software engineer and machine learning engineer.  
I love computer vision and speech processing!  


## Personal Information
- Name: Sou Hasegawa
- Age: 26

## Background
- 2018 ~ : software engineer at Fujitsu
  - I have mainly two jobs. First, I work on developing software products. I have developed the deep learing modules in the product. Second, I work on resolving customers' problems relating machine learning. I have worked on the problems of speech enhancement, speaker diarization and object detection.
  - Besides my work, I do experiments on automatic character generation as my hobby. Please visit my blog because I have written about the results of some experiments.

- 2016~2018 : MEng in Electronics at Kyoto University
  - I worked on the study of thin μ-Si/Si solar cells with photonic crystals. I optimized the structure of photonic crystals using generating algorithm or machine learning and processed solar cells from Si substrate besed on the design. 

- 2012 ~ 2016: BEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Kyoto University
